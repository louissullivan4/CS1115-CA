			<h2>Surfing</h2>
					<p> 
						Louis has been surfing since the age of eight. He started in Oceanics Surf School, Tramore Beach in Waterford.
						For his 12th Birthday he was given a surfboard. It was made by a company called Funkypig. It was a six foot, flat nose hardboard with a fishtail.
						Since his days in Tramore he has surfed in Lahinch, Keel Beach on Achill Island and more recently the surf capital of 
						Europe, Ericeira in Portugal. One of the three International surf capitals, it is often described as a surfing
						Mecca for its abundance of waves. He hopes to join the UCC Surf Club and compete in the intervarsities surf 
						competition.

			<h2>Scouting</h2>
				<p>
					Louis joined Ballygunner scout group at the age of ten. One of his fondest memories was the week he spent hiking in the Icelandic 
					mountain ranges. He and eighteen other scouts from across Ireland were chosen to participate in this event which is known as the Crean Challenge.
					He led a group of ten on a 28km hike which took the group just under ten and a half hours to complete. They visited many interesting locations including
					the international scout centre on <em lang="is">Úlfljótsvatn</em> Lake. He also competed in a national competition where he and his teammate won 
					the national cooking trophy two years in a row. He is now an active Scout Leader in his group.
